=================================================

This project was the first in my Web Developer journey and the first I'll be recreating how that the bootcamp course is complete. It's purpose is to demonstrate basic understanding of HTML and CSS with a focus on acessibilty and semantic markup.

Introduction
------------

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this project I will be refactoring an existing site to make it more accessible.

User Story
------------

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Acceptance Criteria
-----

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Usage
-----

### Basic operation

This project is hosted on GitHub pages, but it is meant to be a simple example of how to refactor a codebase to meet a certain set of standards.
